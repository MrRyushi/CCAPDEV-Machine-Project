This repository contains the main project for the course CCAPDEV in De La Salle University. This website is about a 
computer laboratory reservation system that allows students and/or a lab technician to reserve seats. The project is 
still in Phase 1 (MCO1) and only the front-end has been developed. The lab-tech view provides files specificially for
the laboratory technician's view only as well as for student's view. The default view is the user/visitor's view which
is the main index of this project.

Disclaimers:
Some buttons in this project does not yet have a backend program specificially the 'Search' button in profile pages and 
the 'Check Date' button in the computer laboratory rooms. An access to data is required for it to be implemented which
is covered in the Phase 2 (Back-end).

Clicking on a profile in a visitor's view should be linked to the profile of that user but must not be able to edit it. 
This has not yet been implemented as we need also a backend code for storing live data that will determine if the user
is logged in or not.

For the lab technician to edit any reservation, our idea is that the lab technician can proceed to the profile of the person
and edit the reservations but not the profile.
