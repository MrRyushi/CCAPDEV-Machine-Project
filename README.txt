This repository contains the main project for the course CCAPDEV in De La Salle University. This website is about a 
computer laboratory reservation system that allows students and/or a lab technician to reserve seats. The project is 
still in Phase 1 (MCO1) and only the front-end has been developed. The lab-tech view provides files specificially for
the laboratory technician's view only as well as for student's view. The default view is the user/visitor's view which
is the main index of this project.

Some buttons in this project does not yet have a backend program specificially the 'Search' button in profile pages and 
the 'Check Date' button in the computer laboratory rooms. An access to data is required for it to be implemented which
is covered in the Phase 2 (Back-end).
