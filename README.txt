This repository contains the main project for the course CCAPDEV in De La Salle University. This website is a 
computer laboratory reservation system that allows students and/or a lab technician to reserve seats. The project
is still in Phase 1 (MCO1) and only the front-end has been developed. 

A Few Disclaimers:
- Some buttons in this project does not yet have a backend program specificially the 'Search' button in profile 
pages and the 'Check Date' button in the computer laboratory rooms. An access to data is required for it to be 
implemented which is covered in the Phase 2 (Back-end).

- For the lab technician to edit any reservation, our idea is that the lab technician can just proceed to the 
profile of the person who reserved the specific seat and edit / delete it.

- Muzan Kibutsuji is the default (student) user when logging in or changing to student's view. This means that 
reserving a seat when not anonymous is Muzan Kibutsuji. This will be later modified at Phase 2 to the current 
user logged in.

- The reserved seats located at the right side of every room page should update given the date and time input 
and on the click event of the "Check Date" button.
