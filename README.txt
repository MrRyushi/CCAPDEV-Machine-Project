This repository contains the main project for the course CCAPDEV in De La Salle University. This website is about a 
computer laboratory reservation system that allows students and/or a lab technician to reserve seats. The project is 
still in Phase 1 (MCO1) and only the front-end has been developed. 

A Few Disclaimers:
- Some buttons in this project does not yet have a backend program specificially the 'Search' button in profile pages and 
the 'Check Date' button in the computer laboratory rooms. An access to data is required for it to be implemented which
is covered in the Phase 2 (Back-end).

- For the lab technician to edit any reservation, our idea is that the lab technician can proceed to the profile of the person
and edit the reservations but not the profile.

- Muzan Kibutsuji is the default (student) user when logging in or changing to student's view. This means that reserving a 
seat in student's view is Muzan Kibutsuji. This will be later modified at Phase 2 to the current user logged in.
